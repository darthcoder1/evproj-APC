
The Prototype v0.1 has an error on U3. Trace to PA8 is not connected correctly!

- The inputs are pulled down to ground. I'd rather pull them up to +12v, and switch them to ground to simplify the wiring harness


- There might be a problem with the MAX4558 not switching back to normal operation after an ESD event
  See https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX4558-MAX4560.pdf (page 9)
    "The holding current is typically
     110mA in the positive direction (current flowing into the
     pin) and 95mA in the negative direction at room temperature 
     (see SCR Holding Current vs. Temperature in the Typical 
     Operating Characteristics). The system should be designed 
     so that any sources connected to the X, Y, Z or X_, Y_, Z_ 
     pins are current limited to a value below the holding 
     current. This ensures that the SCR turns off and normal
     operation resumes after an ESD event"
    


TODO:
    * [PCB] add current limiter to MAX4558 sources (Yn) and limit current to 10mA
